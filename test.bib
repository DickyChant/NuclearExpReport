	abstract = {In this thesis, I show my Ph.D. work on event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations for relativistic heavy-ion collision. I show that event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations have become an indispensable tool for studying relativistic heavy-ion collisions and how it can be used to explain many phenomena. Different chapters focus on different topics; it mainly includes: Chap 2: comparison between single-shot hydrodynamics event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations. Chap 3: using the elliptic and triangular flow data measured by the {ALICE} collaboration at the {LHC} to constrain initial condition models. Chap 4: study on correlations between event-plane angles. Chap 5: how resonance decay calculation can be speed up by a factor of 10. Chap 6: study on fluctuations of event planes angle \{{\textbackslash}Psi\}n({pT}) and their theoretical and experimental consequences. Chap 7: sampling particles according to the Cooper-Frye formula.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3312},
	doi = {10.1038/nature10079},
	abstract = {High-energy nuclear collisions create an energy density similar to that of the universe microseconds after the Big Bang, and in both cases, matter and antimatter are formed with comparable abundance. However, the relatively short-lived expansion in nuclear collisions allows antimatter to decouple quickly from matter, and avoid annihilation. Thus, a high energy accelerator of heavy nuclei is an efficient means of producing and studying antimatter. The antimatter helium-4 nucleus (\${\textasciicircum}4{\textbackslash}bar\{He\}\$), also known as the anti-\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} (\${\textbackslash}bar\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$), consists of two antiprotons and two antineutrons (baryon number B=-4). It has not been observed previously, although the \{{\textbackslash}alpha\} particle was identified a century ago by Rutherford and is present in cosmic radiation at the 10\% level. Antimatter nuclei with B {\textless} -1 have been observed only as rare products of interactions at particle accelerators, where the rate of antinucleus production in high-energy collisions decreases by about 1000 with each additional antinucleon. We present the observation of the antimatter helium-4 nucleus, the heaviest observed antinucleus. In total 18 \${\textasciicircum}4{\textbackslash}bar\{He\}\$ counts were detected at the {STAR} experiment at {RHIC} in 10\${\textasciicircum}9\$ recorded Au+Au collisions at center-of-mass energies of 200 {GeV} and 62 {GeV} per nucleon-nucleon pair. The yield is consistent with expectations from thermodynamic and coalescent nucleosynthesis models, which has implications beyond nuclear physics.},

	abstract = {Nuclear collisions recreate conditions in the universe microseconds after the Big Bang. Only a very small fraction of the emitted fragments are light nuclei, but these states are of fundamental interest. We report the observation of antihypertritons - composed of an antiproton, antineutron, and antilambda hyperon - produced by colliding gold nuclei at high energy. Our analysis yields 70 +- 17 antihypertritons and 157 +- 30 hypertritons. The measured yields of hypertriton (antihypertriton) and helium3 (antihelium3) are similar, suggesting an equilibrium in coordinate and momentum space populations of up, down, and strange quarks and antiquarks, unlike the pattern observed at lower collision energies. The production and properties of antinuclei, and nuclei containing strange quarks, have implications spanning nuclear/particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.},

	abstract = {The extreme temperatures and energy densities generated by ultra-relativistic collisions between heavy nuclei produce a state of matter with surprising fluid properties. Non-central collisions have angular momentum on the order of 1000\${\textbackslash}hbar\$, and the resulting fluid may have a strong vortical structure that must be understood to properly describe the fluid. It is also of particular interest because the restoration of fundamental symmetries of quantum chromodynamics is expected to produce novel physical effects in the presence of strong vorticity. However, no experimental indications of fluid vorticity in heavy ion collisions have so far been found. Here we present the first measurement of an alignment between the angular momentum of a non-central collision and the spin of emitted particles, revealing that the fluid produced in heavy ion collisions is by far the most vortical system ever observed. We find that \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$ and \${\textbackslash}overline\{{\textbackslash}Lambda\}\$ hyperons show a positive polarization of the order of a few percent, consistent with some hydrodynamic predictions. A previous measurement that reported a null result at higher collision energies is seen to be consistent with the trend of our new observations, though with larger statistical uncertainties. These data provide the first experimental access to the vortical structure of the "perfect fluid" created in a heavy ion collision. They should prove valuable in the development of hydrodynamic models that quantitatively connect observations to the theory of the Strong Force. Our results extend the recent discovery of hydrodynamic spin alignment to the subatomic realm.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-ex/0503018},
	shorttitle = {Thesis},
	abstract = {Identified mid-rapidity particle spectra of \${\textbackslash}pi{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}pm\}\$, \$K{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}pm\}\$, and \$p({\textbackslash}bar\{p\})\$ from 200 {GeV} p+p and d+Au collisions are reported. This data were taken in 2003 run from the Solenoidal Tracker at {RHIC} ({STAR}) experiment. A time-of-flight detector based on multi-gap resistive plate chamber ({MRPC}) technology is used for particle identification. The intrinsic timing resolution 85 ps was achieved after the calibration. We observe that the spectra of \${\textbackslash}pi{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}pm\}\$, \$K{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}pm\}\$, \$p\$ and \${\textbackslash}bar\{p\}\$ are considerably harder in d+Au than those in p+p collisions. In \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\_\{\_\{{NN}\}\}\} = 200\$ {GeV} d+Au collisions, the nuclear modification factor \$R\_\{{dAu}\}\$ of protons rise faster than those of pions and kaons. Besides, the particle-species dependence of the Cronin effect is observed to be significantly smaller than that at lower energies. The ratio of the nuclear modification factor (\$R\_\{{dAu}\}\$) between \$(p+{\textbackslash}bar\{p\})\$ and charged hadrons (\$h\$) in the transverse momentum range \$1.2{\textless}p\_\{T\}{\textless}3.0\$ {GeV}/c is measured to be \$1.19{\textbackslash}pm0.05\$(stat)\${\textbackslash}pm0.03\$(syst) in minimum-bias collisions and shows little centrality dependence. The yield ratio of \$(p+{\textbackslash}bar\{p\})/h\$ in minimum-bias d+Au collisions is found to be a factor of 2 lower than that in Au+Au collisions, indicating that the relative baryon enhancement observed in heavy ion collisions at {RHIC} is due to the final state effects in Au+Au collisions. The mechanism for Cronin effect is also discussed in this thesis by comparison with the recombination model and with the initial multiple parton scattering model. From the comparisons, we conclude that the Cronin effect in 200 {GeV} d+Au collisions is not initial state effect only, and that final state effect plays an important role.},

	abstract = {We review the most important experimental results from the ﬁrst three years of nucleus-nucleus collision studies at {RHIC}, with emphasis on results from the {STAR} experiment, and we assess their interpretation and comparison to theory. The theory-experiment comparison suggests that central Au+Au collisions at {RHIC} produce dense, rapidly thermalizing matter characterized by: (1) initial energy densities above the critical values predicted by lattice {QCD} for establishment of a Quark-Gluon Plasma ({QGP}); (2) nearly ideal ﬂuid ﬂow, marked by constituent interactions of very short mean free path, established most probably at a stage preceding hadron formation; and (3) opacity to jets. Many of the observations are consistent with models incorporating {QGP} formation in the early collision stages, and have not found ready explanation in a hadronic framework. However, the measurements themselves do not yet establish unequivocal evidence for a transition to this new form of matter. The theoretical treatment of the collision evolution, despite impressive successes, invokes a suite of distinct models, degrees of freedom and assumptions of as yet unknown quantitative consequence. We pose a set of important open questions, and suggest additional measurements, at least some of which should be addressed in order to establish a compelling basis to conclude deﬁnitively that thermalized, deconﬁned quark-gluon matter has been produced at {RHIC}.},
